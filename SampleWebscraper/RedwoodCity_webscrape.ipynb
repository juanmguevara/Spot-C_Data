      "\"At their regularly scheduled meeting Monday, October 26, at 7 p.m., the Redwood City City Council will consider a Revised Fiscal Year 2020-21 Budget, which proposes a reduction in expenditures of $7.7 million from the Fiscal Year 2020-21 Adopted Budget. City operating revenues are expected to drop 8.1% or $13.1 million compared to Fiscal Year 2019-20 and the City expects that it will take at least five years for revenue to return to the Fiscal Year 2019-20 levels. When reduced revenues are combined with known cost increases to fund pension and retiree health obligations over the next 10 years, the City must take action to reduce operating costs and seek new revenues. Without action, the City faces annual deficits of $7-13 million per year for the foreseeable future.  \\u201cThe Revised Budget should be thought of as a transitional budget while staff analyze current services and assess opportunities to reduce costs and modify service delivery approaches. We have work to do, which will involve employees, to consider new models,\\u201d said City Manager Melissa Stevenson Diaz. Reductions would occur in all departments, and include $4.9 million reductions in funding for public safety. In the Fire Department, the savings would be achieved through temporarily closuring of Engine 9 and shifting its calls to Truck 9, as well as leaving vacant aFire Training Captain position. In the Police Department, the savings would be achieved by refraining to fill nine vacant Police Officer positions. The reductions generally freeze in place current staffing levels to allow new service models to develop. The specific reductions required for the long-term could be different from those recommended at this time. \\u201cThe Revised Budget continues the City\\u2019s longstanding practices to support the City\\u2019s financial health, while striving to address critical community needs in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, to advance the City Council\\u2019s top priorities of housing, transportation, and children and youth, and to focus on equity and sustainability,\\u201d Stevenson Diaz said. The Revised Budget also taps into $3 million in one-time funds to fund critical community needs and City Council priorities, including climate adaptation initiatives; coordination and process improvements in the Community Development and Transportation Department; a pilot program pairing mental health clinicians with police officers; and for equity initiatives, including a new position of Equity and Empowerment Officer to lead development of the Equity Workplan.  \\u201cThe work to reimagine City services has begun. It cannot be rushed; it requires analysis, communication, and careful consideration to ensure new models provide the best possible service, while avoiding unforeseen consequences.\\u201d The full staff report can be viewed here (Agenda Item 8.A). The proposed Revised Fiscal Year 2020-21 Budget can be found here. Members of the public may provide input to the City Council at council@redwoodcity.org.

The library is a natural place to explore all aspects of STEAM \\u2013 Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics. \\u201cSTEAM at the Library has quickly become a favorite community event and in spite of COVID-19, this year will be just as exciting, entertaining and educational,\\u201d said Mayor Diane Howard. \\u201cThe library is a vital connector between residents and their success with learning, and is a safe place to imagine, create and grow. We want to ensure everyone \\u2013 children, teens and adults alike \\u2013 have access to all the wonderful tools and resources exploring different elements of STEAM.\\u201d  During STEAM at the Library, participants will enjoy activities for all ages and events exploring different elements of STEAM. STEAM events include a Pop-Up Chemistry series, Family Forensic Chemistry, a Teen COVID Kitchen, Little Learners Lab, STEAM Craft Club, and more. The month wraps up with a series of fun events in partnership with the Bay Area Science Festival, October 21-25, 2020. Due to COVID-19, the library has continued to adapt to connect the community with online resources, services and suggestions for how to keep reading and learning while practicing social distancing. This includes Curbside Service for picking up holds, as well as a variety of online resources, including borrowing eBooks and eAudiobooks; streaming TV, movie, and music services; access to digital subscriptions to newspapers and magazines; online Storytimes for Kids and other events; distance learning support for students; and much more. In addition, earlier this summer, the City Council unanimously approved the elimination of overdue fines, citing that fines were punitive and disproportionately impact low income families and minorities. \\u201cOne of Redwood City Public Library\\u2019s Service Priorities for Redwood City and North Fair Oaks is to provide opportunities for community members of all income levels,\\u201d said Library Director Derek Wolfgram. \\u201cWe are thankful to our partners for allowing us to host STEAM at the Library activities and events free of charge and to the City Council for the elimination of late fines, both signifying steps toward the equity aspiration for the community.\\u201d To learn more about library services, please visit www.redwoodcity.org/library or call (650) 780-7018 ext. 4.

The City Council is legally obligated to pass a budget before June 30, 2020. The Recommended Budget does not change the current service levels, and will be modified in October 2020 to address both anticipated reductions in City revenues and changing community needs. In the last several weeks, the City Council and City staff have received hundreds of requests to revise the budget and to reform policies regarding policing. In turn, the City Manager is recommending several immediate steps in response to community concerns, and is recommending listening, dialogue and action prior to developing a new budget to be considered by the City Council in October 2020. \\u201cThis is a critical time for communities nationwide to listen, learn and act to address racial inequality. Redwood City has a great history of community engagement and collaboration. We are committed to truly hearing from our community, and taking positive steps forward,\\u201d said City Manager, Melissa Stevenson Diaz. The full report with recommendations is available here. Immediate recommended next steps include: Mayor and City Council to endorse the Obama Foundation Mayor\\u2019s Pledge Modify Police Department policies to make the use of carotid restraint a use of deadly force, not allowed as an arrest and control tactic Return military tactical vehicle donated to the Police Department from the federal government Increase frequency of racial and cultural diversity training Preserve art related to the June 2, 2020 Black Lives Matter (BLM) protest and develop a travelling display accompanied by resources on racism for community learning Additionally, the City will develop additional listening opportunities for the City Council and staff to hear from residents regarding their concerns about racism and policing, and ideas for alternative service delivery models. To inform and shape the revised budget to come before the City Council in October, this dedicated community engagement will occur July through September. City staff will also increase information easily available to the public on police use of force and complaints against officers, as well as community policing activities. Community feedback will be an important component to the revised budget developed for City Council consideration in October. In addition to addressing City Council priorities related to financial sustainability, support for vulnerable people in the community, climate adaptation and economic vitality, the revised budget will provide recommendations for increased community involvement in Police policies and activities, and to strengthen the City\\u2019s commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion within the City organization and in the provision of City services.

      "\"Fiscal Year 2020\\u201321 Recommended Budgetsocial@redwoodcity.orgJun 9\\u00b74 min readFiscal Year 2020\\u201321 Recommended Budget Presented June 8; Revised Budget to be Considered in OctoberAt last night\\u2019s City Council meeting (June 8), the City Council received the Fiscal Year 2020\\u201321 Recommended Budget during a Study Session. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic there is a high level of economic uncertainty: our local and national economy are driven by consumer behavior, and it is very hard to predict how that behavior will change.Importantly, while the City Council is required by law to adopt a FY 2020\\u201321 budget before June 30, we expect the budget will change significantly this fall. So, while the FY 2020\\u201321 Recommended Budget is an essential document, it should also be thought of as an interim document. We know that we will need to make significant changes as the economic impacts of COVID-19 become more known, and we know we will need to make changes to the budget in light of evolving community needs and resources. We are listening closely to community concerns, which will help shape proposals that are brought forward to the City Council in October.We are committed to supporting a strong, innovative and collaborative organizational culture as we strive to meet community needs now and in the future.Budget HighlightsWe would like to help clarify some misunderstandings and highlight a few key initiatives in the FY2020\\u201321 Recommended Budget.Parks, Recreation and Community ServicesThe Recommended Budget does not decrease park and recreation services. Mid-year adjustments to the Parks, Recreation and Community Services Department budget will be made this fall to account for grants and other one-time funding, which fluctuate from year to year and are represented in the adjusted budget.Additionally, we have heard from residents seeking more funding for education, mental health and social services. We value these services too, and we actively partner with the education community, San Mateo County, and scores of non-profit and community organizations to support these efforts. Additionally, the City of Redwood City acts as the fiscal agent and backbone organization for Redwood City 2020, a community collaborative comprised of eight partners, including the City of Redwood City, Redwood City Elementary School District, Sequoia Union High School District, County of San Mateo (Health and Human Services Agency), Sequoia Healthcare District, The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University \\u2014 Stanford University, Kaiser Permanente, and Ca\\u00f1ada College. Redwood City 2020\\u2019s vision is \\u201cthat all people living in Redwood City and North Fair Oaks are healthy, safe and successful. We bring our community residents together with local organizations and public agencies to develop and implement a wide range of projects that are focused on addressing acute needs and building on strengths in our community. Our goals are to reduce the impact of poverty, improve the academic success of students, promote community health and wellness, increase community engagement, and enhance safety.\\u201dHousingTo directly support the City Council\\u2019s strategic priority of meeting our unique community housing needs for people at all income levels, the City is directing approximately $9 million in expenditures to produce, preserve, and protect affordable housing in Redwood City. These include:\\u00b7 $1.3 million in programing through federal Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and HOME grants\\u00b7 $1.7 million for the Habitat for Humanity project located at 612 Jefferson Street, which includes 20 housing units\\u00b7 $3.5 million for the ROEM project located at 353 Main Street, which includes 125 housing units\\u00b7 $2 million of housing value from Premia office development impact fees, paid directly to HIP Housing to purchase a 10-unit property to convert to affordable housingOverall, the City expects to complete City Funding Agreements and Restrictions to complete 500+ units of affordable housing production in the 2020\\u201321 fiscal year.The City also has strong partnerships with non-profits and service organizations, most notably to assist with social services and homeless programs, including working towards providing permanent housing options for our RV/Motorhome residents.The Housing Division budget also fluctuates greatly from year to year, dependent upon grant opportunities and funding availability. For example, the City was recently awarded a Challenge Grant from the Partnership for the Bay\\u2019s Future (PBF) to work on housing preservation and protection initiatives. The Challenge Grant includes which a two-year management fellow, technical assistance, access to other PBF funding opportunities, and a direct funding allocation to the City\\u2019s community partner, Legal Aid Society of San Mateo County. The estimated value of the Challenge Grant is over $250,000.Community PolicingThe nationwide dialogue on policing is raising important questions about policing in Redwood City. We know there are a lot of questions from the community on our Redwood City Police policies, training, accountability, and, as we heard during the Budget Study Session, on the department budget. We expect there will be multiple opportunities for community dialogue on policing and community services in the future. The first is a Virtual Town Hall on Wednesday, June 10 at 7 p.m. but we are also planning for additional opportunities and we hope you will take part. We also invite you to visit www.redwoodcity.org/communitypolicing to learn more about the Redwood City Police Department; this web page will continue to be updated with more information on a regular basis, including a Frequently Asked Questions and use of force statistics section coming soon.Thank YouWe want to also take a moment to thank you for your engagement with City Council and City administration, and with each other on these important matters; we welcome the feedback and are hopeful the information included in this Blog has been helpful!

      "\"Recognizing that the success of small businesses contributes to the economic vitality and attraction of Redwood City, earlier this month, the Redwood City City Council approved the contribution of $300,000 to the San Mateo County Strong (SMC Strong) Fund's Small Business Grant Program. The donation will be used to specifically support Redwood City small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic.   \\\"With the goal to provide immediate, practical support to our small businesses, the City Council unanimously approved this funding support,\\\" said Redwood City Mayor Diane Howard. \\\"Our small businesses create jobs, foster innovation and provide essential goods and services. They also create a sense of place unique to Redwood City.\\\"   The SMC Strong Fund is a partnership with Silicon Valley Community Foundation and San Mateo Credit Union to support those most impacted by COVID-19 in San Mateo County. All money donated to SMC Strong will stay inside San Mateo County, so contributors can have confidence that their donations are helping their neighbors. The funds will benefit San Mateo County families and individuals, non-profit organizations, and small businesses impacted by COVID-19.    To further support relief efforts, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) is matching the City's contribution, also donating $300,000 to SMC Strong Fund's Small Business Grant Program. These funds, a total of $600,000, will be allocated specifically to help Redwood City businesses.   \\\"Small businesses help make Redwood City the vibrant and inclusive community we're so proud to call home,\\\" said Cristina Huezo, Director of Community, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. \\\"We want to do our part to support them in this extremely difficult time and look forward to when they can safely open again.\\\"   Locally, CZI is supporting communities most impacted by the pandemic, committing an initial $5 million to assist Bay Area public health agencies, local organizations, and schools in their emergency and long-term relief efforts. CZI is also helping increase access to COVID-19 testing, genomic sequencing, and research, including a collaboration between UCSF, Stanford University, and the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub to better understand the spread of COVID-19 across the San Francisco Bay Area. CZI moved to Redwood City in 2018.   \\\"Today CZI showed they are committed to preserving the vibrancy that first attracted them to Redwood City,\\\" said Councilmember Giselle Hale. \\\"CZI sees our small businesses as an essential part of what makes us special. This funding provides a lifeline to a number of those small businesses at their greatest time of need. That's being a good neighbor. We are proud to have them in Redwood City and thankful for their generosity.\\\"     \\\"I would like to particularly thank Councilmember Giselle Hale for her leadership, and thank CZI for their generous donation,\\\" said Mayor Howard.   The SMC Strong small business grant program received over 2,500 applications within hours of opening on April 27. With a maximum $10,000 grant, current funding needs total $25 million. On March 24, the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors also approved a $3 million contribution of Measure K funds towards SMC Strong, with $1 million pledged specifically for small business relief.   To help temporarily mitigate the financial impacts due to COVID-19 and to stem the potential community deterioration that could result, other businesses and individuals are encouraged to make a donation to SMC Strong.

      "\"The City of Redwood City has been working around the clock to ensure that as a City, we are doing whatever we can to ensure essential services and functions continue during this unprecedented health crisis due to COVID-19. The safety of our community remains of paramount importance. The City was recently made aware of a care facility where there has been substantial concern of potential exposure, or risk to exposure, to COVID-19 and the need for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). It is the City\\u2019s understanding that the County of San Mateo is working with the facility to ensure safety measures are in place and that there is compliance with the County Health Order relating to residential care facilities, issued April 15, which expands COVID-19 screening and monitoring requirements. County Manager Mike Callagy has indicated that San Mateo County Health has deployed a team of clinicians to support resident monitoring and care to Gordon Manor, including providing PPE, as the facility implements measures to regain staffing sufficient to return to its COVID-19 operations. As San Mateo County has authority over the matter, they are handling all media requests. The City can share that, functioning as part of the County\\u2019s Emergency Operations Center, County teams have been activated to assist all residential care facilities in the following manner: Provide Personal Protective Equipment [PPE] (quantities subject to availability) Conduct training on appropriate donning and doffing of PPE Provide information on COVID-19 and lessons learned about containment measures Provide information on the process for resource ordering and disease control investigations Assess supply chain and operational needs The teams are there to provide facilities with support and guidance as we all navigate through the COVID-19 response. The County is also in the process of requesting staff from the state to augment the current support it is providing at the facility. Additionally, the City of Redwood City will conduct check-ins on residential care facilities over the weekend and to provide all facilities with the County's Safety Handbook.  If members of the community already are in possession of PPE and would like to donate, the County of San Mateo is accepting donations from organizations and individuals.

      "\"Redwood City, Calif. -- The City of Redwood City announced today that Stan Maupin, Fire Chief for the Redwood City Fire Department serving the communities of Redwood City and San Carlos, retired. Deputy Fire Chief Dave Pucci will serve as Acting Fire Chief.  \\\"I am infinitely grateful to Chief Maupin for his dedicated service and, particularly for his leadership and professionalism. He is held in the highest regard among both cities' City Councils, City staff, and communities,\\\" said Redwood City City Manager, Melissa Stevenson Diaz. \\\"He has led the department with skill and heart, and been a terrific colleague and member of our executive team. We will miss him very much, and we all wish him the best in his well-deserved retirement.\\\"   Maupin has over thirty years of experience in the fire service. A 13-year veteran of the Redwood City Fire Department, Maupin served as Fire Chief since January 2016 after serving as Deputy Fire Chief for over four years.   \\\"Stan has been a terrific representative of the San Carlos and Redwood City Fire Departments\\\" said San Carlos City Manager, Jeff Maltbie. \\\"As the Deputy Fire Chief assigned to the City of San Carlos, Stan proved to be a caring and collaborative partner in providing exceptional fire services to the San Carlos community. Once he was promoted to Fire Chief, he continued to support San Carlos through his admirable leadership of the Department. We congratulate Stan on his retirement and wish him the best.\\\"   Maupin served for four years as a Corporal in the United States Marine Corps before beginning his career in the fire service as a Volunteer Firefighter with Foster City in 1988. He joined the Tracy Fire Department as a full-time Firefighter in 1990. He moved back to the Foster City Fire Department in 1991, where he worked through the ranks to Battalion Chief before leaving for Redwood City's Fire Department in 2007.   \\\"Serving as Fire Chief for the cities of Redwood City and San Carlos has been the pinnacle of my career and I am grateful for the many opportunities and experiences over the past 30+ years,\\\" Maupin said. \\\"Not many people can say they worked their dream job; I am definitely one of them.\\\"   Maupin is a recognized fire service leader and has had many accomplishments throughout his long career. As strike team leader for nearly 20 years, Maupin helped fight over 15 State of California wildfires and also served as line safety officer to ensure the safety of firefighters statewide. Under his leadership as Fire Chief, the Redwood City Fire Department received the prestigious Public Protection Classification, Class 1 rating from the Insurance Service Office (ISO). ISO's expert staff collects information about municipal fire protection efforts in communities throughout the United States and rates them. Less than 1% of fire departments are classified as Class 1, which represents superior property fire protection.   Maupin was instrumental in the successful negotiation and implementation of the San Carlos Fire Services contract and renewal, an innovative approach to providing high-quality fire services while being financially beneficial to both San Carlos and Redwood City.   Also under Maupin's guidance, modernized technologies used for fire safety inspections were implemented leading to streamlined processes and cost efficiencies, and brought procedures into the 21st century.    Maupin held various leadership positions at the State and County level, including five years as chair of the State of California High Rise Committee, previous chair of the Operations and Training sub-committees of the San Mateo County Fire Chief's Association, pervious chair of the San Mateo County Deputy Chiefs, and chair for multiple years of the San Mateo County Fire Chiefs Association. Maupin is a long-standing member of the International Association of Fire Chiefs and the National Fire Academy.\"\n",

      "\"For immediate release: March 31, 2020 Bay Area Health Officers Issue Updated Stay-at-Home Order with New Restrictions to Last Through May 3 More time and additional restrictions needed to slow the spread and reduce future impact on local hospitals from COVID-19 Health officers in seven Bay Area jurisdictions are extending a previous stay-athome order through May 3, 2020 in order to preserve critical hospital capacity across the region. The previous three-week order was set to expire on April 7. While the prior order has been effective in reducing the rate of transmission of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), it is not enough. There has been a significant increase in the number of positive cases, hospitalization and deaths from COVID-19, which is beginning to strain healthcare resources. The health officers have determined that more and stricter social distancing is needed to slow the rate of spread, prevent deaths, and stop the health care system from becoming overwhelmed. \\u201cExtending the stay-at-home order should reduce the number of sick patients seeking care at one time, giving us time to acquire more medical supplies for providers who will be providing care to people sick with COVID-19. The extension will allow doctors and nurses to better treat those who do get sick, and save countless lives,\\u201d said Dr. Chris Farnitano, health officer for Contra Costa County. The new stay-at-home order will supersede the previous order and go into effect at 11:59 p.m. on Tuesday, March 31. It is a complement to the indefinite statewide stay-at-home order issued by Gov. Gavin Newsom earlier this month. Like the previous local order, the new order requires people to stay at home except for doing essential activities, such as grocery shopping, in six counties: Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, and Santa Clara, as well as the city of Berkeley. Non-essential businesses will remain closed. The new order adds some clarifying language around essential business and activities, as well as some new directives, including: \\u2022 Use of playgrounds, dog parks, public picnic areas, and similar recreational areas is prohibited. These areas must be closed to public use. \\u2022 Use of shared public recreational facilities such as golf courses, tennis and basketball courts, pools, and rock walls is prohibited. These facilities must be closed for recreational use. \\u2022 Sports requiring people to share a ball or other equipment must be limited to people in the same household \\u2022 Requires essential businesses to develop a social distancing protocol before April 3 \\u2022 Most construction\\u2014residential and commercial\\u2014is prohibited \\u2022 Funerals limited to no more than 10 people attending \\u2022 Essential businesses expanded to include service providers that enable residential transactions (notaries, title companies, Realtors, etc.); funeral homes and cemeteries; moving companies, rental car companies and rideshare services that specifically enable essential activities \\u2022 Essential businesses that continue to operate facilities must scale down operations to their essential component only Social distancing is the most powerful tool to slow the spread of COVID-19, a virus so new that it has no approved medicines or vaccines. \\u201cWhat we need now, for the health of all our communities, is for people to stay home,\\u201d said Dr. Grant Colfax, director of the San Francisco Department of Public Health. \\u201cEven though it has been difficult, the Bay Area has really stepped up to the challenge so far, and we need to reaffirm our commitment. We need more time to flatten the curve, to prepare our hospitals for a surge, and to do everything we can to minimize the harm that the virus causes to our communities.\\u201d Read the full press release here.

The World Health Organization declared the rapidly spreading coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic and the United States Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) determined that coronavirus presents a serious public health risk. These conditions are impacting significant City and community operations, including critical public infrastructure, facilities, personnel, equipment and services. The emergency declaration gives the City flexibility to mobilize resources in response to this unprecedented public health threat for the protection of the community. This action will also help ensure critical services have the resources needed to continue. Additionally, it allows the City to request mutual aid from regional, State and other governmental entities. Upon the unanimous adoption of the proclamation by City Council, Redwood City partially activated its Emergency Operations Center (EOC) and the Redwood City Fire Department will continue to support the County of San Mateo\\u2019s activated EOC.

      "\"Hallmark House Apartments \\u2014 February 2020 UpdateCity of Redwood CityFeb 21\\u00b72 min readBuilding permit has been issued for the reconstruction/repair of the 72-unit Hallmark House Apartment buildingProposed Woodside Road FacadeThe Hallmark House Apartment project, located at 531 Woodside Road, reached a new milestone this week \\u2014 a permit was issued by the City of Redwood City, paving the way for reconstruction of the 72-unit apartment building.In addition to a legal dispute between the two property owners, which caused a delay for several years, City building and fire officials were working with the developer to have plans reviewed and submitted for the rebuild. During this period, seeing the process stalling and the blighted property sitting vacant, the City began to cite the property for code violations which amounted to $35,000. This brought the owners back to the table with the City.Because the original rebuild permits lapsed in 2017, it triggered new state Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Adaptability Standards Codes, causing further delays as the property owner decided to redesign the entire building to meet the new ADA code requirements.As part of its review process, the City hired a structural engineering firm to evaluate the condition of the apartment complex and to provide the City with a structural report. Concurrently, the developer hired a Certified Access Specialist to ensure accessibility and compliance with the ADA.Despite the aforementioned delays and complexities with the project, on February 10, the City Council unanimously approved the issuance of tax exempt bond financing for the reconstruction of the building. To be clear, this bond issuance does not create a financial obligation for the City; however, the borrower, Hallmark 2017, L.P., will be able to finance the project, in the amount of $25 million, through tax exempt bond proceeds. It\\u2019s expected that financing will close by April 2020.Construction is expected to commence in May 2020 with an anticipated completion date of June 2021.The affordability of the apartments will continue as before the fire in 2013: 30% of the units will be affordable to very low-income households. The reconstruction plans include 71 one-bedroom units and one studio. Rent for one-bedroom apartments will range between $1,330 and $1,605For more details about the City\\u2019s affordable housing initiatives, go here.To read the Hallmark Homes Apartment September 2019 blog, go here.

      "\"Redwood City Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) February 2020 UpdateCity of Redwood CityFeb 20\\u00b72 min readAs the housing supply and homelessness crisis in California continues, the State Legislature has continually passed numerous new laws and regulations over the last several years, with over 30 different pieces of housing legislation enacted so far in 2020. The City appreciates the community\\u2019s patience as we take the necessary steps to comply with constantly evolving laws and adjust practices in a timely way to limit frustration from property owners.As background, in October 2019, the State Legislature passed three new bills requiring cities to further ease local restrictions on ADUs (also commonly known as second units, granny flats or in-law units) and to allow new types of ADUs in residential dwellings. Overall, these new rules reduce the timeline for permit review, provide for construction of junior ADUs (interior conversions of less than 500 square feet with at least an efficiency kitchen) within single-family homes, allow ADUs in multifamily buildings, increase allowable ADU square footage, limit restrictions on lot size, lot coverage, floor area, and open space, and regulate the short term rental of ADUs.On February 10, 2020, the Redwood City City Council and Planning Commission held a joint study session to discuss these new State law requirements, and clarify the City\\u2019s ability to regulate ADUs with a new City ordinance. The joint study session included presentations from staff and questions from the Commissioners and Councilmembers, more specifically regarding maximum ADU square footage, lot coverage applicability, and maximum height. The study session also provided guidance on adoption procedures and permit applicability.Staff will be analyzing the public comments and the discussion from the joint study session, and will return to the City Council with staff recommendations to amend the City\\u2019s ADU ordinance at the March 23 City Council meeting.For more information on ADUs, please visit www.redwoodcity.org/adu.To read the July 2019 blog \\u201cNew Proposals Addressing Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) Limits and House Size Limits/Floor Area Ratio (FAR),\\u201d go here.You may view the video from the February 10 joint study session here.
